Notes:

Hi everyone, my name is Paul Ganssle, I'm a software engineer at Google and a maintainer of a few open source packages, notably I maintain `dateutil` and I'm a CPython core dev.

Today I'm going to be talking about `pytest` and `unittest`, which is something I unfortunately have a lot of experience with, both at work and in the open source world. In CPython, we more or less have to use `unittest`, because it's *really* hard to bring in third party dependencies in CPython, even just for testing.

At Google, we have historically used our own derivative of `unittest` called `absltest`, and when I first conceived of this talk, it was intended to make the case for why we might want to move *away* from `pytest` and at the very least provide active support for using `pytest` within Google. And in fact I'm happy to report that in the year or so since I made my plea for `pytest`, there actually *has* been some movement in that direction (though we've encountered a... notable setback recently...).
