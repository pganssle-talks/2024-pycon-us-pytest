Why choose `pytest` over `unittest`?

- `unittest` is in the standard library, but `pytest` is the standard way to do testing in Python
- `pytest` is very compatible with `unittest`, so incremental migrations are easy
- `pytest` is extremely feature-rich, and under active development
- Fixture UI and scoping is weird, but fixtures are great
