# `pytest` for `unittest`ers

Are you a `unittest` user interested to learn more about `pytest`? Do you want to learn to write more idiomatic `pytest` tests? Do you use neither and want an overview of some of the differences between the two frameworks? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this talk is for you!

Join us for an introduction to fixtures, test parameterization,and an explanation of some of `pytest`'s subtler user experience enhancements, in a talk that will just scratch the surface of `pytest`'s extensive feature set.
